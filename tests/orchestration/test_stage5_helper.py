"""Tests for ``src.stage5_helper.prepare_neopax_config``.

NEOPAX is configured by a TOML file, not CLI flags. ``prepare_neopax_config``
writes a path-resolved copy of the shared template under the run's Stage 5 output
dir, rewriting its five path fields *relative to that copy's own directory* (NEOPAX
runs there) and never touching the committed template. These tests pin the rewrite
targets, the trailing slash on ``transport_output_dir``, and template immutability.
